# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.16.1] - 2026-03-07

### Changed (1.16.1)

- **Sidebar Section Spacing** — Increased padding and label margins in sidebar sections for better readability.
- **Map Billing Panel** — Added accent left-border, increased padding, shadow depth, and backdrop blur for stronger visual anchoring.
- **Map Overlay Buttons** — Replaced solid-fill action buttons (S3, Backbone, Support) with translucent glassmorphism style matching the dark-themed map aesthetic.
- **AI Edge Tab** — Enlarged tab icon, label, and padding; increased gradient and border opacity so the tab is easier to spot when the AI panel is closed.
- **Map Background in Topology View** — Reduced tile brightness and increased grayscale so the geographic backdrop recedes behind the network diagram.
- **Toolbar Polish** — Increased button padding, divider spacing, and container shadow/blur for a cleaner grouped appearance.
- **Connection Lines** — Bumped link stroke-width and opacity for better visibility; increased label background opacity.
- **AI Response Text** — Added `line-height: 1.6` for breathing room and styled `<strong>` tags in accent color with slight letter-spacing for scannable structure.
- **Suggestion Chips Label** — Added a contextual header ("Try asking" / "Try designing") above the AI suggestion chips so their purpose is immediately clear.
- **AI Panel Shadow** — Added a left-side drop shadow when the panel is open for clear depth separation from the canvas.

### Fixed (1.16.1)

- **Billing Data Transfer Units** — The AI context builder now correctly converts `/traffic/` API values from Bytes to GB before labelling them. Previously, raw byte values were passed as "GB", causing the AI to report wildly inflated transfer numbers (e.g. 144 TB instead of ~134 GB).

## [1.16.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added (1.16.0)

- **Combined "Network Security" Metric** — VDC Health panel now shows a single "Network Security" row combining NIC-based firewall and security group coverage. A server is considered protected if it has either mechanism. The metric description shows the individual breakdown (NIC Firewall: X/Y · Security Groups: X/Y). Clicking the metric enables both firewall and security group highlights simultaneously.
- **VDC Health Two-Column Layout** — VDC Health panel redesigned as a two-column grid: left column shows core health metrics (Security, Network, Performance), right column shows Cost Optimization and AI Compliance Audit. Eliminates scrolling on most screens. Falls back to single column on viewports below 640px.

### Changed (1.16.0)

- **"Firewall Active" → "NIC-based Firewall"** — Renamed the highlight label in all 4 languages (EN, DE, ES, FR) to clarify this refers specifically to the NIC-level firewall mechanism, distinct from security groups.
- **Compliance Rule Restructure** — NET-01 now checks combined network security (FAIL only if a server has neither firewall nor security groups). ACC-01 repurposed as "Security Group Preference" (WARN if firewall-only, encouraging migration to security groups for centralized management).
- **AI Context: Combined Network Security** — Server summary lines in the AI context builder now show `NetSec: FW+SG`, `NetSec: FW`, `NetSec: SG`, or `NetSec: NONE`. Security posture summary shows combined protection count with individual FW/SG breakdown.
- **Toolbar Reorganization** — Toolbar buttons regrouped into logical sections separated by dividers: Navigation/View (Zoom, Reset, Global Map), Data Overlays (Labels, IP, Compute, Highlights), Analysis (VDC Health, Flow Logs, Billing Heatmap, AI), Output (Table, Export).
- **Map Background Always Visible** — The geographic map background is now always shown in Single VDC view. Removed the map toggle button (M) from the toolbar and the `M` keyboard shortcut.

### Removed (1.16.0)

- **Map Background Toggle** — Removed the toolbar button, `M` keyboard shortcut, shortcuts help table row, and all 4 language i18n strings for `toolbar.mapBg` / `shortcuts.mapBg`. The map is now always visible as a backdrop.
- **Separate Firewall / Security Groups Health Rows** — Replaced by the combined "Network Security" metric in VDC Health.
- **Dead `getMetricDesc` Handlers** — Removed unused metric description handlers for the old `firewall` and `secGroups` keys.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added (1.15.0)

- **AI Compliance Checker** — New 12-rule compliance audit engine that evaluates VDC infrastructure across five categories: Network (firewall coverage, flow logs, private LAN isolation, NAT gateway), Access (security groups, NIC multi-queue), Audit (idle VMs, resource labeling), Cost (right-sizing, transfer optimization), and Data (database versioning, HA). Triggered via the "Compliance audit" suggestion chip, `Shift+S` keyboard shortcut, or the "Run Compliance Audit" button in VDC Health panel.
- **Compliance Report Card** — Structured report rendered inline in the AI chat panel with an overall score badge (0–100), per-category progress bars with expand/collapse, individual PASS/FAIL/WARN findings, and clickable resource links that zoom to the matching node on the canvas.
- **Compliance Resource Highlighting** — Clicking a resource name in a compliance finding closes the AI panel, switches to Single VDC view, pans the camera to the node, highlights it with connected links, and auto-restores the previous view after 6 seconds or on background click.
- **Compliance Report Download** — Export the compliance audit as a timestamped `.txt` file with scores and findings per category.
- **Auto-Model Switch for Compliance** — Compliance audits automatically switch to Llama 3.3 70B for better structured output quality, and restore the previous model selection after the audit completes.
- **VDC Health Panel Integration** — The VDC Health (Security Posture) panel now includes an "AI Compliance Audit" section showing the cached compliance score with a metric bar and a "Run Compliance Audit" button.

### Changed (1.15.0)

- **NIC Multi-Queue Property Source** — Fixed `nicMultiQueue` to read from `server.properties.nicMultiQueue` (server-level) instead of the non-existent `nic.properties.nicMultiQueue` (NIC-level). Updated across: highlight check, security posture calculation, AI context builder, and NIC detail panel badge.
- **"Security Posture" → "VDC Health"** — Renamed the keyboard shortcut label from "Security posture" to "VDC Health" for consistency with the panel title.
- **PCC Cross-Connect Z-Index** — Lowered PCC SVG overlay from `z-index: 650` to `450` so it no longer overlaps VDC hover tooltips on the global map.
- **VDC Tooltip Z-Index** — Added `z-index: 700` and increased background opacity to `0.97` for clearer tooltip rendering above PCC lines.

### Removed (1.15.0)

- **"VDC Found" Toast** — Removed the redundant green success toast shown on login ("X VDC found") since the VDC list is already visible in the sidebar.

### Fixed (1.15.0)

- **NIC Multi-Queue Highlight Ring** — VMs with multi-queue enabled now correctly show the highlight ring. Previously the highlight checked the NIC-level property (always undefined) instead of the server-level property.
- **Compliance Parser Flexibility** — The compliance report parser now handles multiple AI output formats: dash-prefixed (`- [PASS]`), no-prefix (`[PASS]`), markdown bold (`**[FAIL]**`), reversed order (`NET-01: [PASS]`), and unicode symbols (`✓`, `✗`, `⚠`). Includes a fallback that infers findings from raw text when regex patterns don't match.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added (1.14.0)

- **Object Storage Overlay** — New "Object Storage" button on the global map toggles an overlay showing IONOS Cloud S3-compatible object storage endpoints. Markers are color-coded by bucket type (green for User-owned, indigo for Contract-owned) with hover tooltips displaying endpoint URL, website URL, and BSI IT Grundschutz compliance status.
- **Bucket Type Filter** — Summary panel includes selectable "User-owned" / "Contract-owned" toggle buttons. Switching filters updates the map markers and endpoint counts in real time. User-owned is the default view.
- **Flex Button Bar** — The three global map overlay buttons (Object Storage, DC Network, Contact) are now wrapped in a flexbox container with uniform 8px gaps, replacing fragile absolute-positioned `right` offsets.

### Changed (1.14.0)

- **Uniform VDC Cluster Bubbles** — All VDC cluster markers on the global map are now a fixed 82×62px regardless of VDC count, replacing the previous variable sizing (72–96px) that caused inconsistent appearance.
- **VDC Cluster Z-Index** — Active VDC cluster markers now render above dimmed available-location markers (`zIndexOffset: 500`) so they are never obscured.
- **Available Location Markers** — Dimmed DC markers made more visible: opacity 0.4→0.6, size 40×34→44×38px, font-size 6.5→7px, text alpha 0.5→0.6, subtle box-shadow restored, hover opacity 0.8→0.9.
- **Global Map Framing** — Switched from `fitBounds` to `setView([46, -20], 3.25)` with fractional zoom (`zoomSnap: 0.25`) and sidebar-aware `panBy` offset for tighter US–Europe framing.
- **Overlay Mutual Exclusion** — All three overlay modes (Object Storage, DC Network, Contact) now fully dismiss each other when activated, clearing markers, summary panels, and active button states.
- **S3 Tooltip Width** — S3 endpoint tooltips use a wider container (320px) to prevent long endpoint URLs from overflowing.
- **S3 Marker Nudging** — Co-located S3 endpoints (e.g., Berlin and Frankfurt) are automatically nudged apart by a minimum of 2.5 degrees to prevent marker overlap.

### Fixed (1.14.0)

- **No-Cache Headers** — Added `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` headers to `serve.py` for non-proxy responses, preventing stale content during development.
- **Contact Button Not Clearing Overlays** — Clicking "Contact" now properly dismisses active DC Network and Object Storage overlays before showing support contacts.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added (1.13.0)

- **Regional Map: VDC Hover Tooltips** — Hovering over a VDC marker in the regional drill-down now shows a frosted-glass tooltip with VDC name, location, and billable data transfer (inbound/outbound) from the Billing API. Tooltip disappears on mouse-out.
- **Regional Map: Availability Zone Badges** — VDC markers are color-coded by AZ (green for AZ 1, amber for AZ 2, purple for AZ 3) with a small "AZ N" badge shown when multiple AZs exist in the same region. Makes it easy to distinguish `de/fra/1` from `de/fra/2` at a glance.
- **Regional Map: PCC Cross-Connect Lines** — Private Cross Connect links between VDCs in the same region are rendered as dashed orthogonal SVG paths (soft purple) routed above the markers, with PCC name labels. Data fetched from `/pccs?depth=3` API. Lines update live on map pan/zoom and are cleaned up on navigation.
- **DC Network Backbone Overlay** — New "DC Network" button on the global map toggles an overlay showing all 11 IONOS data center locations as backbone nodes (AS-8560) with a summary panel displaying edge capacity (4,000 Gbps), peering sessions (3,500+), and metro redundancy tiers.
- **Voice Input for AI Assistant** — Microphone button next to the AI input textarea enables voice-to-text via the Web Speech API. Supports all four languages (EN/DE/ES/FR), shows a pulsing red indicator while listening, and auto-sends the transcribed message on speech end.
- **Karlsruhe DC Location** — Added `de/ka` (Karlsruhe) to the location registry with coordinates, city name, and cloud type classification.

### Changed (1.13.0)

- **"Data Transfer" → "Data Transfer (Billable)"** — All references to billing-sourced data transfer now include "(Billable)" or "(Billable, current period)" to clarify the data comes from the IONOS Billing API. Updated across all four languages (EN, DE, ES, FR) in the map billing panel, detail panel, heatmap button/tooltip, keyboard shortcuts help, feature carousel, and AI context summary.
- **Billing Period Label** — Changed from "30d" to "current period" (and locale equivalents) since the Billing API returns the current calendar month, not a rolling 30-day window.
- **Billing Chart Y-Axis** — Y-axis now adapts to actual data values instead of flooring at 1 GB. Uses `d3.scaleLinear().nice()` for clean tick marks and automatically switches to MB units when values are below 0.5 GB.
- **Regional Map Zoom Level** — Increased drill-down zoom from `+2` to `+3` for a closer view of VDC markers within a region.
- **AI Context Strings** — AI context builder now labels transfer data as "Billable Data Transfer" for clearer LLM understanding.

### Fixed (1.13.0)

- **Non-ISO-8859-1 Token Error** — Pasting API tokens containing hidden Unicode characters (e.g., smart quotes from rich-text editors) caused `fetch()` to throw "String contains non ISO-8859-1 code point". Fixed by stripping non-printable-ASCII characters from the token input.
- **AI Button Visibility Null Safety** — `updateAiButtonVisibility()` could throw if `graphData` was null. Fixed with optional chaining (`graphData?.nodes?.length`).
- **DC Network Button Text Wrapping** — The "DC Network" button text wrapped to two lines on narrow viewports. Fixed with `white-space: nowrap`.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added (1.12.0)

- **AI Design Mode (Dual-Tab UI)** — The AI Cloud Assistant now has two tabs: **Assist** (existing analysis/export functionality) and **Design** (new architecture designer). The Design tab provides a dedicated mode for building infrastructure topologies from natural language, with its own conversation, system prompt, suggestions, and welcome message. Switching between tabs preserves each tab's state independently.
- **Design Mode Map Backdrop** — Entering Design mode displays an interactive Leaflet map centered on Frankfurt (de/fra) at zoom level 7 as the canvas backdrop, with boosted brightness and contrast (`design-backdrop` CSS class). The map is visible behind the topology as architectures are designed, giving geographic context to the infrastructure being planned.
- **Design Mode Empty State** — A subtle hint pill ("Describe your architecture in the AI panel to get started") appears at the top of the empty design canvas over the map backdrop, replacing the previous onboarding empty state.
- **Design Mode Auto-Model Switch** — Automatically switches to Llama 3.3 70B when entering Design mode (better JSON generation quality) and restores the previous model when switching back to Assist.
- **Design Mode View Restriction** — Design mode is only available in Single VDC view. Switching to Global Map or By Location view shows a clear message explaining the restriction and disables input. Re-evaluates automatically when the view mode changes.
- **Design Suggestions Dropdown** — 10 architecture templates available: 4 shown as quick-access chips (3-tier web app, K8s cluster, Microservices, Simple website) plus 6 more in a "More" dropdown (VPN gateway, CI/CD pipeline, HA database cluster, Dev/staging/prod, Data analytics, WordPress hosting). The dropdown opens upward with frosted-glass styling and closes on outside click.
- **Dedicated Design System Prompt** — Design mode uses a completely separate system prompt that mandates `_ai_graph` JSON output (never Terraform HCL), includes node/link schema documentation, connectivity rules, and a CRITICAL ITERATION RULE requiring full JSON re-emission on every modification request.
- **Draft Topology Injection for Iteration** — When iterating on an existing draft design, the current `_draftGraphData` is serialized as JSON and prepended to the user's message, giving the AI model full visibility of the current state to apply modifications accurately.
- **Orphan Node Validation** — `buildDraftGraphData()` now detects and auto-removes empty/disconnected LANs and auto-connects orphan resources (servers, databases, etc.) to the nearest private LAN, preventing broken topologies from AI output.
- **Load Balancer Parent-Child Layout** — Servers directly connected to an ALB or NLB are detected and positioned as children below the load balancer tier. LB children are evenly spread horizontally around their parent LB's X position with dedicated Y-tier positioning (`lbChild` at 0.68) and stronger X-clustering force (0.18).
- **Draft Mode Spacing** — Draft topologies use increased link distances (1.4x), stronger charge repulsion (1.5x), and extra collision padding (+15px) compared to real topologies, ensuring nodes have breathing room on the map backdrop.
- **Kafka Node Color Fix** — Changed Kafka cluster node color from `#231f20` (near-black, invisible on dark theme) to `#e07a2f` (orange, matching Apache Kafka branding).

### Changed (1.12.0)

- **Pre-login Map Prominence** — Map backdrop during the login/onboarding screen is now more visible: dark theme opacity increased from 0.45 to 0.70 with brightness 0.9 (was 0.7); light theme opacity increased from 0.60 to 0.75 with brightness 0.95 (was 0.92).
- **Global Map Cluster Redesign** — Cluster markers changed from circles to rounded rectangles with frosted glass effect (`backdrop-filter: blur(6px)`), softer borders, and updated sizing. Same aesthetic applied to VDC drill-down markers and available location markers.
- **Map Cluster Collision Avoidance** — Nearby clusters (e.g., Frankfurt/Berlin) are automatically nudged apart by a minimum distance of 2.5 degrees to prevent overlapping markers.
- Load balancer Y-force strength increased from 0.25 to 0.30 for stronger tier positioning.

### Fixed (1.12.0)

- **TypeError on Design tab switch** — `emptyState.querySelector('h2')` returned null because the onboarding element uses different selectors. Fixed by creating a separate `#designEmptyState` overlay div.
- **AI returning Terraform instead of JSON in Design mode** — The model sometimes followed the Terraform code path when design instructions were mixed with Terraform instructions. Fixed by using a completely separate system prompt in Design mode.
- **AI not updating topology on iteration** — When asked to modify a draft (e.g., "update VMs to 2 cores"), the model returned text descriptions without re-emitting JSON. Fixed by injecting current draft topology into the message and strengthening the iteration rule.
- **Design tab stuck in blocked state after view switch** — Design tab restriction wasn't re-evaluated when view mode changed. Fixed by calling `switchAiTab('design')` at the end of `setViewMode()`.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added (1.11.0)

- **Kubernetes Managed Resource Badges** — Resources that belong to a Managed Kubernetes node pool (servers, LANs, NAT gateways, PCCs) are automatically identified via the IONOS Labels API (`/cloudapi/v6/labels?depth=2&filter.key=managedexternally`) and marked with an official K8s helm wheel badge (blue heptagon + white 7-spoke wheel) at the bottom-right of the node. K8s-managed status is also shown in the hover tooltip (`⎈ K8s` tag), the detail side panel (blue "⎈ K8s Managed" badge), and the AI assistant context.
- **VDC Name Tooltip** — Hovering over the VDC boundary name label shows an interactive tooltip with UUID (click-to-copy), location, description, state, creation date, and resource count summary. Tooltip supports mouse-over interaction with delayed hide.
- **AI Context: Resource UUIDs** — The AI Cloud Assistant now includes UUIDs for VDCs, servers, LANs, databases, and infrastructure nodes in its context, enabling it to answer questions like "what is the UUID of this VDC?"
- **Terraform Export (Phase 1)** — Ask the AI assistant to "Export as Terraform" and it generates complete, production-ready HCL using the `ionos-cloud/ionoscloud` Terraform provider. Covers all resource types: datacenters, servers, LANs, NICs, NAT gateways, load balancers, databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, MariaDB), Kubernetes clusters, NFS, Kafka, VPN gateways, and cross connects. One-click `.tf` file download from the AI response.
- **NL Architecture Designer (Phase 2)** — Describe desired infrastructure in natural language ("Design a 3-tier web app with ALB, 2 servers, and PostgreSQL"). The AI generates a structured architecture proposal that renders as a **draft topology** on the canvas — visually distinct with dashed borders and a "DRAFT" banner. Iterate via chat ("Add a NAT gateway", "Make servers 8 cores"). When satisfied, click "Generate Terraform" to produce the HCL. Draft mode is cleanly separated from real infrastructure — discard anytime to restore.

### Changed (1.11.0)

- **Performance: Overlapping NIC fallback with managed services** — Restructured `loadVDC()` so NIC fallback resolution starts as soon as DC details arrive, overlapping with still-pending managed service API calls (previously serialized behind all 12 calls)
- **Performance: Same overlap applied to `loadLocation()`** — Region view benefits from the same parallelization
- **Performance: Removed `drop-shadow` from highlight classes** (P2-11) — SVG `filter: drop-shadow()` forces CPU rasterization per frame; highlight styling now uses stroke-only approach
- **Performance: O(1) `nodeMap` lookups replace `.find()` scans** (P2-12) — 10 instances of `nodes.find(n => n.id === nodeId)` in DBaaS sections and layout engine replaced with `nodeMap.has()`/`nodeMap.get()`
- **Performance: Non-critical scripts deferred** (P2-13) — `defer` attribute added to xlsx, pako, jspdf, jspdf-autotable script tags to avoid blocking first paint
- **Performance: Cached heatmap halo D3 selection** (P2-02) — `heatmapHaloGroup.selectAll()` result cached to avoid DOM re-query every simulation tick
- **Performance: UUID regex hoisted to module scope** (P3) — Compiled once instead of per-call
- Performance timing instrumentation added to `loadVDC()` (DC details, NIC fallback, total API, buildGraph, renderGraph)
- Theme toggle and language selector controls reduced from 28px to 22px with smaller fonts, shifted upward for a more compact header
- Light mode IP labels changed from blue text to dark slate (`#0f172a`) with solid white 4px stroke halo for readability

### Fixed (1.11.0)

- IP address labels unreadable in light mode — blue text was invisible against light blue node fills
- VDC tooltip UUID wrapping awkwardly — widened to 420px with CSS grid layout and monospace font

## [1.10.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added (1.10.0)

- **On-Demand Idle VM Scan** — New "Scan for Idle VMs" button in VDC Health panel that batch-fetches real-time telemetry (Prometheus `irate()` queries for `instance_network_in_bytes` / `instance_network_out_bytes`) for all servers. Identifies two categories: stopped-but-billed VMs (vmState=SHUTOFF, metadata state=AVAILABLE) and running VMs with near-zero traffic (avg < 100 B/s). Progress bar UI during scan with cached results for highlights and AI context.
- **Idle VM Highlight** — New "Idle VMs (Stopped & Billed)" checkbox in Highlights overlay under a "Cost Optimization" group. Highlights idle VMs with amber rings on the topology. Requires a scan to be run first (toast prompt if toggled without scan data).
- **Support Contacts on Global Map** — Pill-shaped "Contact" button (bottom-right of map) that overlays flag-emoji Leaflet markers for 9 countries (Germany, Austria, France, Spain, Italy, UK, US, Canada, Mexico) with themed popups showing support and sales phone numbers and email addresses. Visible on both pre-login and post-login maps; auto-hides when drilling into a region or viewing VDC topology.
- **NIC Multi-Queue Highlight** — New highlight checkbox for NICs with multi-queue enabled
- i18n keys for idle VM / cost optimization features across all 4 locales (EN, DE, ES, FR)

### Changed (1.10.0)

- **Performance: Parallelized connect() flow** — Contracts and datacenters now fetched simultaneously via `Promise.all` instead of sequentially, saving the duration of the faster request
- **Performance: Non-blocking user info fetch** — JWT decode and `/um/users/` API call no longer blocks billing, DNS, and IP loading; runs as fire-and-forget async IIFE that updates the UI when ready
- **Performance: Parallelized loadVDC() flow** — NIC fallback resolution and K8s node pool fetching now run in parallel instead of two sequential stages
- **Performance: Parallelized loadLocation() flow** — Same NIC + K8s parallelization applied within each VDC in the multi-VDC region view
- AI assistant `max_tokens` increased from 1024 to 4096 to prevent response truncation on longer outputs (e.g., Terraform generation)
- IONOS API state handling corrected: `INACTIVE` metadata state = deallocated (not billed), removed non-existent `DEALLOCATED` state. Only vmState=SHUTOFF with metadata state=AVAILABLE is flagged as a cost candidate.
- Idle VM scan results included in AI context with detailed per-VM info (vmState, resourceState, traffic data)
- AI suggestions updated to reference idle VM scan results when available

### Fixed (1.10.0)

- **Cross-connect visibility in region view** — Cross-connect lines and shared PCC nodes now stay visible when only one of the connected VDCs is collapsed. Previously, collapsing the VDC whose `_vdcIdx` matched the link would hide the cross-connect even though the other VDC was still expanded. Fixed by tracking `_vdcIdxSet` (all VDC indices an element spans) and only hiding when ALL connected VDCs are collapsed.
- Idle VM detection incorrectly flagging INACTIVE (deallocated/not-billed) VMs as cost candidates — now requires both vmState=SHUTOFF AND metadata state=AVAILABLE

## [1.9.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added (1.9.1)

- **IONOS Documentation Search (MCP)** — AI assistant can now search the official IONOS Cloud documentation via the GitBook MCP server (`docs.ionos.com/cloud/~gitbook/mcp`). Toggle the "Docs" button in the AI panel header to enable/disable. Results are appended to AI context so answers are grounded in official product docs.
- MCP client with session management: `initialize` → `tools/list` (auto-discovers search tool) → `tools/call` with JSON-RPC 2.0 over Streamable HTTP
- New `/mcp-docs` proxy endpoint in `serve.py` — forwards JSON-RPC requests to GitBook MCP, handles SSE-to-JSON conversion for Streamable HTTP transport
- **Feature carousel on pre-login onboarding** — 5-slide auto-rotating showcase (AI Cloud Assistant, Global Traffic Map, DNS & CDN Discovery, Flow Log Explorer, Billing & Data Transfer) with dot navigation, pause-on-hover
- **Progressive loading screen on connect** — 6-step animated checklist (authenticating, loading datacenters, building map, fetching billing, discovering DNS, ready) with progress bar and smooth fade-out
- **VDC drill-down loading** — 4-step animated checklist (servers, NICs, managed services, graph rendering) matching the connect loading style for consistency
- AI context scoping labels: `[Contract-wide]` prefix for billing/VDC inventory sections, `[VDC-name]` prefix for topology, servers, LANs, databases, security sections. System prompt instructs the AI to distinguish between contract-wide and VDC-specific data.

### Changed (1.9.1)

- VDC inventory in AI context now sourced from Cloud API `/cloudapi/v6/datacenters` instead of billing API — fixes inaccurate counts (billing included deleted VDCs, missed zero-traffic ones)
- Removed pricing labels from AI model selector dropdown and README (costs change frequently)
- AI-first README hero section with tagline and dedicated AI Cloud Assistant section with example prompts
- Onboarding subtitle updated across all 4 locales to highlight AI-powered insights
- `serve.py` CORS headers updated to expose `Mcp-Session-Id` for MCP session management

### Fixed (1.9.1)

- AI panel close animation causing layout glitch — content overflowing during width transition. Fixed by using `min-width` transition, removing `overflow: visible`, and conditionally applying `border-left` only when panel is open
- White/blue band across map when AI panel is open during navigation — Leaflet default `#ddd` background was showing through unloaded tiles; set map container background to `var(--bg-primary)`. Added `ResizeObserver` on `.main-area` for automatic `invalidateSize`. Root fix: AI panel now auto-closes before map navigation so container dimensions are stable when Leaflet calculates tile bounds
- Toolbar buttons overflowing outside the bar when AI panel is open — added `max-width: calc(100% - 40px)` constraint with flexible button shrinking; reduced padding and gap for compact layout
- AI panel auto-closes on navigation (global map, VDC switch, location view) to prevent map resize artifacts and toolbar overflow
- VDC loading overlay showing onboarding content bleed-through — changed from semi-transparent `rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.85)` to fully opaque `var(--bg-primary)` with `z-index: 200`
- MCP docs search failing silently — added SSE response parsing in proxy, dynamic tool name discovery via `tools/list`, robust JSON-RPC error handling, and diagnostic logging

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added (1.9.0)

- **AI Cloud Assistant** — General-purpose AI-powered infrastructure analysis using IONOS AI Model Hub (OpenAI-compatible API). Analyzes topology, security posture, billing/traffic, flow logs, and database services. Slide-out chat panel with multi-turn conversation, model selector (Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral Small 24B, Llama 3.3 70B), cost banner, and context-aware quick suggestions. Press `A` to open.
- Dynamic AI context builder (`buildAiContext`) sends topology summary, server inventory with specs, LAN layout, database services, network infrastructure, security posture metrics, billing/data transfer stats, and flow log analysis to the model
- Dynamic suggestion buttons that adapt based on loaded data: infrastructure summary, security assessment, traffic patterns, rejected flows, cost optimization, database overview
- Context-aware system prompt (`buildAiSystemPrompt`) adapts persona based on available data (topology, flow logs, billing)
- All VDC names from billing API included in AI context (covers entire contract, not just loaded VDC)
- **Flow Log Enrichment** — IP-to-resource tagging (maps IPs to servers/services via topology), well-known port labels (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, MySQL, etc.), and threat/scan flagging (Telnet, SMB, RDP, VNC + ICMP probes on REJECT)
- NIC-to-server resolution: "Server / NIC" column shows server name alongside full NIC UUID
- "External" badge on REJECT rows for unresolved IPs
- **Right-click context menu** on flow log rows: Copy Row, Copy Source IP, Copy Dest IP, Copy NIC UUID, Copy as JSON, Filter by Source IP, Filter by Dest IP. Works in both inline and pop-out tables.
- Horizontal scroll on enriched flow log table (`min-width: 1100px`)
- Proxy POST support in `serve.py` for AI Model Hub API (`do_POST` handler forwarding request body)

### Changed (1.9.0)

- AI panel title: "Network AI Assistant" → "AI Cloud Assistant"
- AI button now visible as soon as topology loads (not only when flow logs are loaded)
- AI model costs updated to EUR pricing from official IONOS SE price list
- `escapeHtml()` rewritten from DOM-based (createElement per call) to pure string replacement — eliminates thousands of temporary DOM elements during table rendering
- System prompt includes anti-hallucination instruction: "Only reference resources explicitly present in context"
- `serve.py` CORS headers updated to allow POST method
- Locale dropdown alignment: consistent 28px height matching theme toggle, centered vertically

### Fixed (1.9.0)

- Context menu click handlers not firing: root cause was `flCtxRecord` set before `hideFlContextMenu()` which nulled it out; moved assignment after hide call
- Context menu event delegation: replaced `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper (already fired by script execution time) with direct event delegation on `#flContextMenu` using `e.stopPropagation()`
- AI guard blocking all messages when no flow logs loaded — now allows messages with topology-only data

### Security (1.9.0)

- Prompt injection defence: new `sanitizeName()` strips newlines, control characters, and limits to 100 chars on all infrastructure names before AI context embedding
- AI context overflow protection: `AI_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` (12,000) truncates large topologies to stay within model token limits
- AI request timeout: `AbortController` with 45-second timeout prevents hung requests
- AI rate limiting: 2-second cooldown between requests prevents spam

- VDC sidebar dropdown font size normalized to 12px to match other sidebar elements
- Escape key handling extended: closes flow log dropdown, heatmap overlay, and flow log explorer in priority order
- Map click handler extended: clicking the map background now also clears active heatmap overlays

### Improved (1.7.0)

- Tick callback performance: pre-cached VDC node references and replaced 4× `d3.min/max` calls with single-pass bounds calculation
- Heatmap halo position updates: uses pre-built `_nodeMap` for O(1) lookups instead of `Array.find()` in hot path
- Flow log parsing: `Array.push(...records)` instead of `Array.concat()` to avoid full-array copy on each file load
- Flow log table rendering: array-based HTML assembly with `.join()` instead of string concatenation
- Flow log statistics: single-pass accept/reject counting instead of two separate `.filter()` scans
- Heatmap data aggregation: memoized `aggregateFlowData()` with automatic cache invalidation on data changes
- Flow path resolution: persistent IP→nodeId, NIC→nodeId, and BFS adjacency lookup maps built once in `renderGraph()`, reducing `resolveFlowPath()` from O(n) node scan per call to O(1) map lookups
- Event listener deduplication: `_flDropBound` guard prevents accumulating duplicate drag/drop handlers on repeated dialog opens
- Error handling: `parseFlowLogFile` wraps `file.arrayBuffer()` in try/catch with descriptive error propagation

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-16
