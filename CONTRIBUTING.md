## Code Style Guidelines

IONOS Cloud Network Visualizer follows these conventions:

- **Single-file architecture**: Keep the main application in a single HTML/JS file for simplicity
- **D3.js patterns**: Use D3 selections and data binding idiomatically
- **CSS variables**: Define colors and sizing as CSS custom properties for consistency
- **Comments**: Document complex logic, especially data transformations
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable/function names; abbreviations only for common conventions (e.g., `d` for data)
